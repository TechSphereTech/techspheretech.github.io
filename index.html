  <h1>Server-side Technologies</h1><br>

  <button class="accordion">ExpressJS</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Express.js is the most popular web framework for Node.js. It is designed for building web applications and APIs and has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.</p>
    <h3>Features of ExpressJS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Routing: - In Node JS, we have a module called http to create a server, where we create a server using http.createServer and pass a callback function to http.createServer, where we get requests and responses as s parameter and using if else and URL, we setup routes. </li>
        <li>Middlewares: - Node JS does not contain any middleware by default, but we can create our own custom middleware in it. Instead of Node JS, Express.js contains built-in middleware like express.static() to server static files to clients. </li>
        <li>Error Handling: - Express JS, it is much easier to handle errors because there are multiple ways to handle errors, like asynchronous handling, global error handling, etc. </li>
        <li>Request & Response Object: - Request and Response means what is requested by the client side and, in exchange for that request, what data is sent to the client side from the server side in terms of response. The request and response object is contained in both Node JS and Express JS, but still, Express JS comes with multiple additional functionalities in this object. </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">Ruby on Rails</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Ruby on Rails (RoR) is open-source full-stack framework software specifically to build different web applications. Ruby on Rails has two parts:Ruby-  The general-purpose programming language that’s super versatile.Rails – Frameworks for creating websites, apps, and systems. It’s almost like an entirely user-friendly default structure, making it convenient to build anything.</p>
    <h3>Features of Ruby on Rails</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Secure: Ruby on Rails framework has default settings for all the necessary security features. While you use Ruby on Rails, you’ll be following a secure development process without even knowing it. </li>
        <li>Flexible: The flexibility of Ruby on Rails simplifies the frontend and backend, making the creation of web applications more accessible. Typically, a web application might need to use Rails on the backend, but it can easily use another programming language on the frontend. These capabilities give developers the freedom to harness Ruby on Rails based on what suits their needs, seamlessly blending different coding languages.</li>
        <li>Scalable: Ruby on Rails is super scalable; developers can run the same code on different platforms. The scalability of Ruby on Rails gives applications or websites the power to handle more web traffic while operating perfectly, ideal for social media networks or streaming services.</li>

  <button class="accordion">ASP.NET</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>ASP.NET is a framework that many web developers use to build modern web applications, services and hubs that allow connected clients to access new content in real time. This framework works alongside the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), the standard protocol used for all web applications. </p>
    <h3>Features of ASP.NET</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Asynchronous via Async/Await: Asynchronous programming patterns is now implemented in all .net frameworks classes and 3rd party libraries. You know why asp.net is faster, because of its wide use of asynchronous patterns in kestrel frameworks. However, most of the applications spend their lots of time waiting for database queries, web services call and its input-output operations to complete. </li>
        <li>Globalization and Localization: We host the web application, and it can be accessed from anywhere globally. So, language, date and time format, number format, the currency must be different for different regions or countries. ASP.NET supports globalization so that different countries’ clients or people also can understand, and they can access this application. ASP.NET customize our application for different languages with the help of resource files. These files act as a central repository where all the texts are placed.</li>
        <li>Security: As it supports the .net framework so it will provide security for our application. Applications have its individual identity, so before running this .net will check its identity of those objects. It will also check the operating system security. Due to its pre-application configuration and feature of built-in windows authentication, our developed application is safe and secure. With built-in Windows authentication and per-application configuration, your applications are safe and secured. </li>
        <li>Cross-Platform and Container Support: As we say it supports cross-platform means it supports Windows, macOS, and Linux. So, if we create ASP.NET application then we can directly deploy it on these platforms. </li>
    </ul>
